Some experimenting with using computer vision on recorded matches

The most basic idea would just be recording movement and estimating changes in
position based on where they're at in the camera feed. That gives you an idea
of how mobile a robot is.

But all sorts of things are possible with the idea. Could be a neat way of
augmenting typical scouting data.
